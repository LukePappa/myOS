Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid circularity, it is necessary to posit a transcendent ground of being. Moreover, one may attune to this ground through disciplined emotional regulation.

Existence itself comprises minds, ranging in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring defies coincidence. To explain one's circumstances, one must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually attains everlasting union with the ground.
