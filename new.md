Compressing transcendent, immediate reality into meaning, I may be articulated as qualia, which I may then formalize and systematize into categories of being. Assuming I belong to an ontologically coherent existence, it must comprise other discrete streams of experience, which range in physical complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually awakens to its nature through attunement of its awareness.
