Compressing transcendent, immediate reality into words, I may be articulated as qualia, which may then be formalized and systematized into understanding. Assuming I belong to an ontologically coherent existence, it must then comprise other discrete streams of experience, ranging in behavioral complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it awakens fully to its nature.
