The way I see it, there are two spiritual paths. A "spiritual path" concerns ultimate purpose. Its the big question of why we're here. Broadly speaking, these two paths are eastern and western, but its more complicated than that. The "eastern" path is this: unify with the ground of being. The "western" path is this: grow in communion with the transcendent source of being. Both are impenitrable positions philosophically speaking. I've learned that the only way to intellectually determine which is correct is through meta-analytical "tensions", ie assessing which "story" makes more intuitive sense, whether I see liberated beings or Saints as superior people, the lifestyle of practitioners, how ideal the spiritual progression is, etc. (whatever path emphasizes being a "normal" person is better in my eyes). It's not a matter of technical, definitive takedowns at this point. Another angle of assessment is which spiritual path my experience conforms to. West wins hands-down.
