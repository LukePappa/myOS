The way I see it, there are two spiritual paths. A "spiritual path" concerns ultimate purpose. Its the big question of why we're here. Broadly speaking, these two paths are eastern and western, but its more complicated than that. The "eastern" path is this: unify with the ground of being. The "western" path is this: grow in communion with the transcendent source of being. Both are impenitrable positions philosophically speaking. I've learned that the only way to intellectually determine which is correct is through meta-analytical "tensions", ie assessing which "story" makes more intuitive sense, whether I see liberated beings or Saints as superior people, the lifestyle of practitioners, how ideal the spiritual progression is, etc. (whatever path emphasizes being a "normal" person is better in my eyes). It's not a matter of technical, definitive takedowns at this point. Another angle of assessment is which spiritual path my experience conforms to. West wins hands-down. 

I'm the type of person who has trouble staying interested in things. I don't have many hobbies, theres no career path that interests me, I get bored online almost immediately these days. The only thing that has captured my attention and fascinated me endlessly for years is the idea of ultimate purpose, and discovering what that is and seeking to fulfill it. I've probably spent north of 10,000 hours over 8 years writing and thinking about it on my computer and phone, which isn't counting the amount of time I spend outside of that in contemplation. I think my intense, desperate search for truth stems from very negative experiences I had when I was 18, which set me on this path. Depression basically. It's ultimately been a good thing I think. If I was more normal, I would definitely not have as rich an inner life.

I like the idea of the ultimate reason for existence being communion. An interesting thing I think about is that we talk about the relationship in very human-centric ways. Like if we evolved to be solitary creatures like tigers or something, I wonder what language we'd use, since we'd be less concerned with having a loving companion. Part of me wonders if tiger people would perfer eastern, and what that says about how arbirtrary this all is. That's why intellectually determining things is still important, not just vibes.

I recently had a crisis of "faith" in God after staring down into my dark basement when I was home alone. I got creeped out, and I jokingly said to myself that I was "sensing the presence of evil". It then hit me that maybe my experience of god was just the inverse of that feeling. That is, being so happy and content that you swear your in the presence of a benevolent entity. This was devistating because it rendered my experiences easily explainable as merely a psychological quirk. I was indeed feeling a presence, but it was like the inverse of being alone in the woods at night and swearing something is with you. It's hard to understate how significant this problem is, because my entire spritual life hinged on it. The saints offered no answer. All they said was if the experience bore fruit then it was from God. Mine do, but that didn't really help dispel my concerns. The answer, I found, was recontextualizing what I experienced and being more precise. I wasn't "sensing the presence of God", I was "becoming conscious of the divinity that underlies everything". This language totally validates things and is awesome.
