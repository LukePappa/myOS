The way I see it, there are two spiritual paths. A "spiritual path" concerns ultimate purpose. Its the big question of why we're here. Broadly speaking, these two paths are eastern and western, but its more complicated than that. The "eastern" path is this: unify with the ground of being. The "western" path is this: grow in communion with the transcendent source of being. Both are impenitrable positions philosophically speaking. I've learned that the only way to intellectually determine which is correct is through meta-analytical "tensions", ie assessing which "story" makes more intuitive sense, whether I see liberated beings or Saints as superior people, the lifestyle of practitioners, how ideal the spiritual progression is, etc. (whatever path emphasizes being a "normal" person is better in my eyes). It's not a matter of technical, definitive takedowns at this point. Another angle of assessment is which spiritual path my experience conforms to. West wins hands-down. 

I'm the type of person who has trouble staying interested in things. I don't have many hobbies, theres no career path that interests me, I get bored online almost immediately these days. The only thing that has captured my attention and fascinated me endlessly for years is the idea of ultimate purpose, and discovering what that is and seeking to fulfill it. I've probably spent north of 10,000 hours over 8 years writing and thinking about it on my computer and phone, which isn't counting the amount of time I spend outside of that just thinking about the problems. I think my intense, desperate search for truth stems from very negative experiences I had when I was 18, which set me on this path. Intense depression basically. It's ultimately been a good thing I think. If I was more normal, I would definitely not have gone down this road.
