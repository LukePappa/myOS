Any naturalistic justification for existence must pressupose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circularity, it is necessary to posit a transcendent ground of being: God. Moreover, one may develop an awareness of the divinity that underlies everything when they stop inflicting misery upon themselves in response to external events, the actions of others, and their own shorcomings.

Existence itself comprises minds, ranging in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind perceives the world-branch in which it unites with God, attaining Ennea.
