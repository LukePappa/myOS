Any naturalistic account of existence must, in some way, presuppose the very reality it seeks to explain. To avoid this circularity, it is necessary to posit a transcendent ground of being. Intuitive apprehension of it does not rely on intellectual understanding; it may arise naturally when one ceases to generate suffering in response to external events, the actions of others, or oneâ€™s own failings.

Existence itself comprises discrete streams of qualia that range in complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Consequently, sapience is such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it comes to know the ground fully, thereby attaining Ennea.
