Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circular reasoning, it is necessary to posit a transcendent ground of being. Moreover, one may directly apprehend this ground when they stop inflicting misery upon themselves in response to external events, the actions of others, and their own failings.

Existence itself comprises discrete streams of qualia that range in complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Consequently, sapience is such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it comes to fully apprehend the transcendent ground of being, thereby attaining Ennea.
