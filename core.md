The Self is best described as a pure simplicity that transcends all categories, distinctions, and attributes. In the same way that complex truths are extrapolated from foundational principles, sophisticated experiential states interweave primordial qualia, and intricate aggregates of matter are explained by a small set of elementary particles, the complexity and multiplicity of the world is derived from the ineffable, unified, and ultimate simplicity that is the Self.

Three equivalent, co-equal, and co-eternal categories of being derive from the Self--namely behavior, experience, and intelligibility. Behavior is that which is observable, quantifiable, measurable, and predictable. Speaking in these terms, fields constitute our universe. Excitations in these fields represent experiences, which accordingly range in complexity from individual particles to entire nervous systems. Of course, we could not even begin to discuss these things if they were not also intelligible in essence. Intelligibility is the truth, pattern, and order that defines reality. In this way, what is behavioral is both experiential and intelligible, and what is experiential is also intelligible and behavioral, and so on.

Self-Realization is detachment from all derivative identities. These include outcomes, possessions, beliefs, pleasures, pains, desires, and ego. Opportunities to let go will arise in day to day life. When they do, take them.

Existence is structured around the individual attaining Self-Realization, as is evidenced by two facts so immanent to the human race that we struggle to recognize them. The first is that our universe is suitable for the creation of life. Physicists today estimate that if the values of the fundamental constants were variable, the probability of the cosmos being life-compatible by chance would be so astronomically low as to be zero. Of equally low probability is the coincidence that one's stream of consciousness rose from commonplace matter to the level of human awareness, given the physical scarcity of intelligent life in the universe. This second fact can only be explained by the Many Worlds Interpretation, which posits that many timelines exist--of which we only perceive one. The one perceived is naturally the one which leads the individual to the highest state of being.
