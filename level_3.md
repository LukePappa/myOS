Compressing transcendent, immediate reality into meaning, I may articulate myself as experience. I can then formalize and systematize experience into categories of being. Speaking in those terms, existence comprises minds, ranging in complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually attains everlasting attunement to its transcendent ground.
