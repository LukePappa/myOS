Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circularity, it is necessary to posit a transcendent ground of being: God. Moreover, one may attune to God by relinquishing self-inflicted misery.

Existence itself comprises minds, ranging from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and propose that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which they unite with God, attaining Ennea.

The individual will encounter three distinct stages of spiritual life on their journey toward Ennea. The first of these is the Honeymoon Stage, during which one first experiences God. This period may last several months, marked by frequent encounters with God as a loving, ecstatic presence. Eventually, these sweet experiences begin to dry up, signaling the onset of the Ascetic Stage. During this period, the individual increasingly foregoes worldly pleasures in favor of solitude and finer attunement to God, this time as the divinity that underlies all things. From there, they gradually proceed into the third and final form of spirituality, the Meditative Stage. At this point they seek only the stillness of seated meditation, attuned perfectly to God, the transcendent ground of being.

Attunement to God hinges on relinquishing self-inflicted misery, so it is important to understand precisely what that means. First and foremost, it is about recognizing yourself as the source of your misery. You impose suffering upon yourself in reaction to external events, the actions of others, and your own shortcomings. For example, if someone cuts you off on the road, you add to the offense by choosing to inflict anger upon yourself. To give another example, say your grades are poor and you feel guilty about it, you may choose to worsen the situation by inflicting shame upon yourself. I could give a million more examples, but the point is that misery is not projected into you by the environment, but consciously generated within you as reaction to things. You are your own torturer. The second thing you have to realize is that self-inflicted misery is never the appropriate choice in any situation. What this means is that you can unthinkingly hold to the principle of relinquishing it, soley to avoid suffering, and then rationalize it later if you want to. This cave-man-like reasoning is actually what I fall back on in tough times. In the beginning I had to constantly remind myself not to inflict misery whenever something bad happened or my mind started going places, but now it's part of my nature. This practice of relinquishing misery isn't about turning into a perfect person, its about putting your heart in the right place, and it does that perfectly.
