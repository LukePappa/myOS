Any naturalistic justification for existence necessarily presupposes that which it seeks to explain. To avoid this circularity, a transcendent ground of being must be posited. Moreover, one may attune to this ground simply by regulating their emotions.

Existence itself comprises minds, ranging from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of one's circumstances, one must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which unites with the ground.
