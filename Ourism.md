Any attempt to offer a purely naturalistic justification for existence inevitably encounters a fundamental problem: it must, in some way, presuppose the very reality it seeks to explain. Every naturalistic account begins within the framework of being itself, appealing to laws, processes, or entities that already exist, and thus cannot ultimately account for why there is something rather than nothing. This inherent circularity undermines the claim that existence can be fully explained in immanent or self-contained terms. To escape this logical impasse, one must posit a transcendent source or ground of being, something that exists not contingently but necessarily, and that can serve as the ultimate foundation for all that is. This transcendent ground, beyond the contingent order of nature, is what we mean by God.

One may orient themselves toward the transcendent by relinquishing self-inflicted misery. Things like anger, shame, and envy are not imposed by circumstance; they are generated within. To see this clearly is to understand that one is both the author and the victim of needless torment. Upon relinquishment, one will experience three distinct periods of spiritual life. The first of these is the Honeymoon Stage, during which one first encounters God. This time is marked by frequent encounters with God as a loving, ecstatic presence. Eventually, these sweet experiences begin to dry up, signaling the onset of the Ascetic Stage. During this period, one increasingly foregoes worldly pleasures in favor of solitude and finer attunement to God, this time as the divinity that underlies everything. From there, they gradually proceed into the third and final form of spirituality, the Meditative Stage. At this point one seeks only the stillness of seated meditation, attuned perfectly to God, the transcendent ground of being. Reaching this point takes a very long time; one must not rush into it.

Existence itself may be conceived as populated by minds of varying complexity, ranging from minimally responsive particles or simple systems to fully integrated and adaptive nervous architectures. Sapience, the capacity for self-reflection, abstract reasoning, and purposive thought, emerges only at the extreme upper end of this spectrum. Its appearance is contingent upon an extraordinarily narrow convergence of structural, biological, and historical conditions; the vast majority of configurations in the universe never attain it. For any single mind to possess sapience is therefore not just rare, but profoundly improbable. To personally acquire this faculty is to occupy a position of exceptional statistical and existential uniqueness, a chance so slender that it defies coincidence. To explain my circumstances, then, I must invoke the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it unites with God. In this way my humanity is rendered ordinary, unprivileged, and expected.
