Any attempt to offer a purely naturalistic justification for existence inevitably encounters a fundamental problem: it must, in some way, presuppose the very reality it seeks to explain. Every naturalistic account begins within the framework of being itself, appealing to laws, processes, or entities that already exist, and thus cannot ultimately account for why there is something rather than nothing. This inherent circularity undermines the claim that existence can be fully explained in immanent or self-contained terms. To escape this logical impasse, one must posit a transcendent source or ground of being, something that exists not contingently but necessarily, and that can serve as the ultimate foundation for all that is. This transcendent ground, beyond the contingent order of nature, is what we mean by God.

One orients oneself toward the transcendent through mature responses to external circumstances, the actions of others, and one’s own nature. One should experience three successive periods of spiritual life. The first of these can be called the Honeymoon Stage, during which one first encounters God. This time is marked by frequent encounters with God as a loving, ecstatic presence. Eventually, these sweet experiences begin to dry up, signaling the onset of the Ascetic Stage. During this period, one increasingly foregoes worldly pleasures in favor of solitude and finer attunement to God, this time as the divinity that underlies all things. From there, one gradually proceeds into the third and final form of spirituality, the Meditative Stage. At last, one seeks only the stillness of seated meditation, attuned perfectly to God, the transcendent ground of being. Reaching this point takes a very long time; one must not rush into it.

Taking things a step further, it wouldn't be inaccurate to say that becoming perfectly attuned to God is actually one's true purpose. Existence itself may be conceived as populated by minds of varying complexity, ranging from minimally responsive particles or simple systems to fully integrated and adaptive nervous architectures. Sapience, the capacity for self-reflection, abstract reasoning, and purposive thought, emerges only at the extreme upper end of this spectrum. Its appearance is contingent upon an extraordinarily narrow convergence of structural, biological, and historical conditions; the vast majority of configurations in the universe never attain it. To personally acquire this faculty is to occupy a position of exceptional statistical and existential uniqueness, a chance so slender that it defies coincidence. The only way to make sense of one's circumstances, then, is to invoke the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it unites with God. It is within this context that one's life may be rendered ordinary, unprivileged, and expected.
