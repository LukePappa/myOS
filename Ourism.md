Any attempt to offer a purely naturalistic justification for existence inevitably encounters a fundamental problem: it must, in some way, presuppose the very reality it seeks to explain. Every naturalistic account begins within the framework of being itself, appealing to laws, processes, or entities that already exist, and thus cannot ultimately account for why there is something rather than nothing. This inherent circularity undermines the claim that existence can be fully explained in immanent or self-contained terms. To escape this logical impasse, one must posit a transcendent source or ground of being, something that exists not contingently but necessarily, and that can serve as the ultimate foundation for all that is. This transcendent ground, beyond the contingent order of nature, is what we mean by God.

Moreover, one may attune to God through the deliberate relinquishment of self-inflicted suffering. This begins with the recognition that misery arises not from external events themselves, but from the inward reactions they provoke. When one encounters insult, disappointment, or failure, the pain that follows is often intensified by the mind’s own resistance and judgment. Anger, guilt, and shame are not imposed by circumstance; they are generated within. To see this clearly is to understand that one is both the author and the victim of needless torment.

The individual will experience three distinct stages of spiritual life. The first of these is the Honeymoon Stage, during which one first encounters God. This period may last several months, marked by frequent encounters with God as a loving, ecstatic presence. Eventually, these sweet experiences begin to dry up, signaling the onset of the Ascetic Stage. During this period, the individual increasingly foregoes worldly pleasures in favor of solitude and finer attunement to God, this time as the divinity that underlies all things. From there, they gradually proceed into the third and final form of spirituality, the Meditative Stage. At this point they seek only the stillness of seated meditation, attuned perfectly to God, the transcendent ground of being.
