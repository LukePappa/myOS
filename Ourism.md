Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circularity, it is necessary to posit a transcendent ground of being: God. Moreover, one may attune to God by relinquishing self-inflicted misery.

Existence itself comprises minds, ranging from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and propose that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which they unite with God, attaining Ennea.

The individual will encounter three distinct stages of spiritual life on their journey toward Ennea. The first of these is the Honeymoon Stage, during which one first experiences God. This period may last several months, marked by frequent encounters with God as a loving, ecstatic presence. Eventually, these sweet experiences begin to dry up, signaling the onset of the Ascetic Stage. During this period, the individual increasingly foregoes worldly pleasures in favor of solitude and finer attunement to God, this time as the ever-present divinity that underlies all things. From there, they gradually proceed into the third and final form of spirituality, the Meditative Stage. At this point they seek only the stillness of seated meditation, attuned perfectly to God, the transcendent ground of being.
