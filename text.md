Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circularity, it is necessary to posit a transcendent ground of being: God. Moreover, one may attune to God by relinquishing self-inflicted misery.

Existence itself comprises minds, ranging from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and theorize that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which they unite with God, attaining Ennea.

The spiritual life proceeds in distinct phases that an individual will pass through on the journey toward Ennea. Crucially, they must be allowed to unfold naturally, as it takes time for the brain to reorganize itself. The first of these stages is the Honeymoon Phase, during which one first experiences God. This period may last several months, marked by frequent encounters with God as a loving, ecstatic presence. Eventually, these sweet experiences begin to dry up, signaling the onset of the Ascetic Phase. In this stage, the individual gradually reduces worldly pleasures, seeking solitude and finer attunement to God as the ever-present divinity underlying all things. Finally, the spiritual journey culminates in the Meditative Phase. Here, the individual seeks primarily the stillness of seated meditation, attuned perfectly to God, the transcendent ground of being.
