Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circularity, it is necessary to posit a transcendent ground of being: God. Moreover, one may develop an awareness of God by bringing their attention to the present. 

Existence itself comprises minds, ranging from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Consequently, sapience is such a rare and significant privilege that personally gaining it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind perceives the world-branch in which it unites with God--Ennea.
