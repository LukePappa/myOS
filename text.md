Compressing indescribable, immediate reality into meaning, I may articulate myself as experience. I may go on to reinterpret qualia as patterned activity, and then systematize my grasp of that activity into the discipline of physics. With that base of understanding, I can infer that existence comprises discrete streams of consciousness, of which I am one.

Streams range in experiential complexity from solitary atoms to entire nervous systems, making my elevation from commonplace matter to sapience an impossibly rare and significant privilege. Given all the possible ways in which the universe could have unfolded, the chance that this happened to me is vanishingly small.

There is a threshold at which someone must consider whether their fortune can be more rationally explained by something other than coincidence, and becoming human far exceeds it. To truly make sense of my circumstances, I must posit that each stream perceives the world-branch in which it comes to know the fullness of being—undifferentiated unity.

A quiet, unpreturbed mind is most receptive to unity. I must therefore stop inflicting misery upon myself as a reaction to external events, the actions of others, and even my own shortcomings. I must understand that it is never the appropriate response to a situation, and I must reject it as an impulse.
