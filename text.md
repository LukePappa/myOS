Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid such circular argumentation, it is necessary to posit a transcendent source of being: God. By this definition, God precedes attributes, reason, and activity. Moreover, much as the intellect sees truth, the heart can feel His presence. It can do so only after it stops inflicting misery upon itself in response to external events, the actions of others, and its own shortcomings--after it is purified.

Existence itself comprises discrete streams of experience that range in complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. The consequent rarity and significance of sapience makes personally acquiring it defy coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually enters into an eternal and perfect communion with God.
