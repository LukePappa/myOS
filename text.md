Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circular argumentation, it is necessary to posit a fully transcendent source of being: God. Moreover, much as the intellect sees truth, a pure heart can become filled with His presence. A person capable of communion is one who does not inflict misery upon themselves in response to external events, the actions of others, and their own shortcomings.

Existence itself comprises discrete streams of experience that range in complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually enters into an eternal and perfect communion with God.
