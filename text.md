Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circularity, it is necessary to posit a transcendent ground of being: God. Moreover, one may attune to God by relinquishing self-inflicted misery.

Existence itself comprises minds, ranging from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and theorize that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which they unite with God, attaining Ennea.

There are distinct phases of the spiritual life which the individual may pass through on the way to Ennea. The first of these is the Honeymoon Phase, which corresponds to the time in which the individual is first encountering God. This period can last a few months, and in that time they may frequently experience God as a loving, ecstatic presence. This love will eventually dry up, and that indicates the beginning of the Ascetic Phase. During this time, the individual will begin to forego the pleasures of life in favor of time alone with God. God becomes an ever-present divinity within all things. After some time, the individual will enter into the third and final period of spiritual life, the Meditative Phase. They desire only seated meditation, during which they are fully united to God, the transcendent ground of being.
