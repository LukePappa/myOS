Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circular argumentation, it is necessary to posit a transcendent source of being: God. Moreover, one may become aware of the divinty that underlies everything through maturity, cultivated by consciously choosing the appropriate reactions to external events, the actions of others, and one’s own nature. 


Existence itself comprises discrete streams of experience that range in complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Consequently, sapience is such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and theorize that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually enters into a perfect communion with God.
