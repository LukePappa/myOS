Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circularity, it is necessary to posit a transcendent ground of being: God. Moreover, one may attune to God by relinquishing self-inflicted misery.

Existence itself comprises minds, ranging from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and theorize that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which they unite with God, attaining Ennea.

The spiritual life unfolds in distinct phases that an individual may pass through on the journey toward Ennea. The first of these is the Honeymoon Phase, during which one first encounters God. This period may last several months, marked by frequent experiences of God as a loving, ecstatic presence. Eventually, this intense sense of divine love begins to fade, signaling the onset of the Ascetic Phase. In this stage, the individual gradually renounces worldly pleasures, seeking solitude and deeper communion with God. God becomes an ever-present divinity that underlies all things. Finally, the spiritual journey culminates in the Meditative Phase. Here, the individual seeks primarily the stillness of seated meditation, experiencing full union with God, the transcendent ground of being.
