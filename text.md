Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circular reasoning, it is necessary to posit a transcendent ground of being: God. Awareness of this ground, however, does not depend on speculative reasoning, but may arise naturally when one stops inflicting misery upon themselves in response to external events, the actions of others, and their own shortcomings.

Existence itself comprises discrete streams of qualia that range in complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Consequently, sapience is such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and theorize that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually achieves full awareness of God.
