Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. To avoid such circular reasoning, it is therefore necessary to posit a transcendent source of being: God. By this definition, God is above properties, logic, and causality. He is accordingly uncreated and unconstrained in essence and ability. Moreover, much as the intellect sees truth, the heart can sense His presence. It can do so only after it stops inflicting misery upon itself in response to external events, the actions of others, and its own shortcomings--after it is purified.

Existence itself comprises discrete streams of experience that range in complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Given the rarity and significance of sapience, personally transforming from commonplace matter into a human being defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually enters into an eternal and perfect communion with God.
