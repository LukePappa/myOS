Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circular argumentation, it is necessary to posit a fully transcendent ground of being: God. Moreover, one may experience the divinity that underlies everything simply by not inflicting misery upon themselves in response to external events, the actions of others, and their own shortcomings.

Existence itself comprises discrete streams of experience that range in complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Consequently, sapience is such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and theorize that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually unites with God.
