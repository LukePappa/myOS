Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circular argumentation, it is necessary to posit a fully transcendent source of being: God. Moreover, much as the intellect sees truth, a pure heart can be filled with His presence. A heart capable of communion is one that does not inflict misery upon itself in response to external events, the actions of others, and its own shortcomings.

Existence itself comprises minds--discrete streams of experience that range in complexity from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and theorize that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which it eventually enters into an eternal and perfect communion with God.
