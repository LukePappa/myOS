Any naturalistic justification for existence must presuppose some element of what it seeks to explain. Thus, to avoid circularity, it is necessary to posit a transcendent ground of being: God. Moreover, one may attune to God when they cease to inflict misery upon themselves in response to external events, the actions of others, and their own shortcomings--when they purify their heart.

Existence itself comprises minds, ranging from singular particles to entire nervous systems. Sapience is consequently such a rare and significant privilege that personally acquiring it defies coincidence. To make sense of my circumstances, then, I must invoke the MWI and posit that each mind subjectively perceives the world-branch in which they attain Theosis.
